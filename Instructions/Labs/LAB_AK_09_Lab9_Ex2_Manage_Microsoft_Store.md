# Module 9 - Lab 9 - Exercise 2 - Manage the Microsoft Store for Business

In this exercise, you will add five apps to Adatum's company store, and you will create a collection of three apps that will also be added to the store. You will then verify how those apps appear in the company store to an Adatum employee.

### Task 1: Add apps to your private store 

1. On LON-CL1, you should still have the **Microsoft Store for Business** tab open in your Edge browser. If so, select it now; otherwise, navigate to **https://www.microsoft.com/business-store** and sign in as **Holly@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).

2. In the **Microsoft Store for Business**, you ended the previous exercise by renaming Adatum's private store and verifying the product apps that are available in it. In the menu bar at the top of the page, select **Shop for my group**. 

3. In the next several steps, you are going to get five apps, all of which you will add to Adatum's company store. You will make them available in the store for other Adatum employees, but you will NOT install them yourself. <br/>

	Begin by scrolling down to the **Made by Microsoft** section and select **Translator.**

4. On the **Translator** window, select the drop-down arrow in the **License type** field and note the two options - **Online** and **Offline**. Select the **Online** option, and then select **Get the app**. 

5. On the **Thanks for your order** page, select **Close**. 

6. This returns you to the **Translator** page. Select the **ellipsis (…)** button that appears to the right of the **Install** button to view the additional actions that are available besides Install. Notice that only the **Manage** option is available. 

7. Select **Shop for my group** on the menu bar, then scroll down to the **Made by Microsoft** section and select **Show all**.

8. In the **Made by Microsoft** window, select **Fresh Paint.**

9. On the **Fresh Paint** window, leave the **License type** on **Online** and select **Get the app.**

10. On the **Thanks for your order** page, select **Close**. 

11. Select **Shop for my group**, then scroll down to the **Made by Microsoft** section and select **Show all.**

12. In the **Made by Microsoft** window, select **Reader**. 

13. On the **Reader** page, the **License type:** field currently displays **Online**. Select the drop-down arrow in the **License type** field and select **Offline**, and then select **Get the app.**

14. On the **Thanks for your order** page, select **Close**. 

15. On the menu bar at the top of the page, select **Manage.**

16. On the **Overview** page, in the **Products and Services** tile, select **Manage apps.**

17. On the **Products and Services** page, as you scroll down through the apps, note how they all have an **Install** button - except for **Reader**, which you selected with an **Offline** license type. In the **Reader** section, under **Settings and Actions**, select **More actions available on details page.**  <br/>

	‎**Note:** The **More actions available on details page** option may not immediately appear at this time. Because you selected this app for Offline use, it may take some time for this button to appear. If this **More actions available on details** option does not appear, simply proceed to the next step; otherwise, select this option, and on the **Reader** detail page, note the **Download package for offline use** message and that a **Download** button is available (do not select it).

18. On the menu bar at the top of the page, select **Adatum private store.** 

19. Now that you have added these five individual apps to the company store, you will create a collection of apps that will be bundled together. On the **Adatum private store** page, select **+Add collection.**

20. In the **Add a collection** window, under **Give this collection a name**, enter **Collection1** in the **Enter a collection name** field. 

21. Scroll down and select the **Add** button below each of the following products: 

	- **Fresh Paint**

	- **Microsoft Remote Desktop**

	- **Translator** 

22. At the bottom of the page, select **Done**. 

23. By default, new apps are only visible to admins; as a result, they must be assigned visibility permissions to be seen by non-admins. So at this point in time, **Collection1** is only visible to admins.   <br/>

	Perform the following steps to assign visibility permissions to other users for the **Fresh Paint**, **Microsoft Remote Desktop,** and **Translator** apps:

	- On the menu bar at the top of the page, select **Manage.**

	- On the **Overview** page, in the **Products and Services** tile, select **Manage apps**.

	- On the **Products and Services** page, scroll down through the apps and select **Fresh Paint.**

	- On the **Fresh Paint** window, select **Private store availability**. Under **Choose groups of people who can see this app**, select **Everyone** if it’s not already selected.

	- If you had to select **Everyone** in the prior step, scroll to the top of the page where you can see a **Your changes have been saved** message at the top of the window.

	- Select the back arrow to the left of the address bar to return back to the **Product and Services** page. Repeat these steps for **Microsoft Remote Desktop** and **Translator**.

24. Leave the **Microsoft Store for Business** tab open in your Edge browser. You will use this in the next task. 


### Task 2: View your private store as a company employee 

In this task, you are going to sign into the Microsoft Store for Business as one of Adatum’s employees, Joni Sherman. You’ll then verify that when Joni navigates to Adatum’s private store, she can see the 5 apps that Holly added to the private store, as well as the collection of apps that Holly created in the prior task. 

1. Switch to LON-CL2 where you should be logged in as the **Admin** account, and into Microsoft 365 as Joni Sherman (**jonis@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com)** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. If you are still logged into Microsoft 365 as another user, select the user ID in the upper right corner, select **Sign out,** and then close the other tabs in the browser. 

3. In your **Edge** browser, open a new tab and then enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://www.microsoft.com/business-store**

4. On the **Microsoft Store for Business** page, in the upper-right corner of the page, select **Sign in.** 

5. If you are not signed in automatically as Joni Sherman, then enter **JoniS@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

7. In the **Microsoft Store for Business**, on the menu bar at the top of the page, select **Adatum private store.**

8. In the **Adatum private store**, verify that Joni can see the following: 

	- The five apps that were automatically added to the private store: **Sway, OneNote, PowerPoint Mobile, Excel Mobile,** and **Word Mobile**.

	- The **Collection1** app that you created in the prior task that includes: **Fresh Paint, Microsoft Remote Desktop,** and **Translator**.
